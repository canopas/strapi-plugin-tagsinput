## How to Install

Using npm,

```
npm i strapi-plugin-tagsinput
```

Using yarn,

```
yarn add strapi-plugin-tagsinput
```

## How to use

After installation, you can add tagsinput as a custom field.

#### Suggestions for tag

While adding tagsInput, you will see the `API URL` field.

If you want to use REST API for suggestions, then add your API url in this field.

**Notes:**

- If the API domain is different, then a full API URL is required. i.e. `http://localhost:1337/api/tags?fields[0]=name` (Make sure API CORS are enabled for your strapi domain in this case).
- Otherwise, add only the path of API i.e `/api/tags?fields[0]=name`
